- **Reproducible deployments** across multiple environments
- **Version control** of infrastructure changes
- **Automated resource provisioning** and destruction
- **State management** for infrastructure consistency

- Internet gateway and routing configuration
- Security group and firewall rule establishment

**Phase 2: Database Infrastructure**
- PostgreSQL cluster provisioning with managed service

- SSL certificate provisioning and configuration
- Traffic routing rule establishment

## üîÑ Load Balancing Architecture

### Distribution Strategy

**Round-Robin Algorithm**
The load balancer implements round-robin distribution, ensuring equal traffic distribution across all healthy backend servers. This approach provides:
- Uniform resource utilization across server instances
- Predictable traffic patterns for capacity planning
- Simple configuration and maintenance
- Effective for homogeneous server environments

**Health Check Mechanism**
Continuous health monitoring ensures traffic only routes to healthy instances:
- **Health Check Interval**: Every 30 seconds
- **Failure Threshold**: 3 consecutive failures trigger removal
- **Recovery Threshold**: 2 consecutive successes restore service
- **Health Check Path**: `/health` endpoint validation

### High Availability Features

**Automatic Failover**
When a server becomes unhealthy, the load balancer automatically:
- Removes the failed server from the active pool
- Redistributes traffic among remaining healthy servers
- Continues health checks for automatic recovery
- Restores service when the server becomes healthy

**Session Persistence**
While this implementation uses stateless design, the infrastructure supports:
- Sticky session configuration for stateful applications
- Cookie-based session affinity
- IP-based session persistence
- Custom header-based routing

## üåê API Endpoints and Load Balancing Verification

### Health Monitoring Endpoints

**Load Balancer Health Check**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /health`
- **Purpose**: Verifies application health for load balancer
- **Response**: JSON with server status and timestamp
- **Load Balancer Usage**: Automatic health check target

**Individual Server Information**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /server-info`
- **Purpose**: Displays which server handled the request
- **Response**: Server ID, hostname, and processing timestamp
- **Load Balancing Demo**: Shows traffic distribution across servers

### User Management API

**User Listing**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve all users from shared database
- **Database Integration**: Demonstrates shared data consistency
- **Load Balancing**: Each request may hit different servers

**User Creation**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/users`
- **Purpose**: Create new user records
- **Database Writes**: Tests write consistency across load-balanced servers
- **Response**: Includes server ID that processed the request

**Individual User Operations**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/:id`
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/users/:id`
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/users/:id`
- **Purpose**: Full CRUD operations through load balancer
- **Consistency**: Shared database ensures data consistency

### Analytics and Monitoring

**Request Statistics**
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/stats`
- **Purpose**: Display request counts and server distribution
- **Analytics**: Shows load balancing effectiveness
- **Monitoring**: Request patterns and server utilization

**Request Logging**
- **Database Table**: `requests_log`
- **Tracking**: Every API request logged with server ID
- **Analytics**: Traffic patterns and load distribution analysis
- **Performance**: Response time and throughput metrics

## üîí Security Architecture

### Network Security

**VPC Isolation**
- Private network segment for all infrastructure components
- Network isolation from other tenants and public internet
- Internal communication through private IP addresses
- Controlled ingress and egress traffic rules

**Firewall Configuration**
- **Load Balancer**: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) from internet
- **Application Servers**: Port 3000 only from load balancer
- **Database**: Port 25060 only from application servers
- **SSH Access**: Port 22 from specific IP ranges only

**Database Security**
- SSL-encrypted connections with certificate validation
- Private network access only (no public endpoint)
- User-based access control with least privilege
- Automated security updates and patches

### Access Control

**Service-to-Service Authentication**
- Load balancer to application server communication
- Application server to database authentication
- API key-based authentication for external services
- Certificate-based SSL/TLS encryption

**Administrative Access**
- SSH key-based authentication for server access
- Terraform service account with minimal permissions
- Database admin access through private networking only
- Infrastructure changes through version-controlled IaC

## üìä Load Balancing Verification Methods

### Traffic Distribution Testing

**Server Identification Method**
Each API response includes a `server_id` field that identifies which backend server processed the request. By making multiple requests to the same endpoint, you can verify:
- Requests are distributed across different servers
- Load balancing algorithm is functioning correctly
- No single server is handling all traffic
- Failed servers are properly excluded from rotation

**Statistical Analysis**
The `/api/stats` endpoint provides comprehensive metrics:
- Total requests per server instance
- Request distribution percentages
- Server response time averages
- Failed request counts and error rates

### Real-World Load Testing

**Concurrent Request Testing**
Using tools like Apache Bench, curl scripts, or Postman Runner:
- Send 100+ concurrent requests to verify distribution
- Monitor server resource utilization during load
- Verify database connection pooling effectiveness
- Test failover scenarios by stopping server instances

**Database Consistency Verification**
- Create users through different server instances
- Verify all servers see the same data (shared database)
- Test transaction consistency across load-balanced writes
- Validate session-less application design
